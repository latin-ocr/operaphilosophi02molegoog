Tmo poem, which is represented by our author in hie στιγμαὶ,
published in 1657, ns having been “made long sinoe” (see
vol. vii. p. 389), appears to have been written iu the interval
between the suecession os his first pupil, William Lord
cavendish, to the title of Euri of Devonahire, and his daath,
that is to say, between 1626 md 1628 :—

Sed Dominum, men Mun, eoin, eui genu vetum
ono dut titulos Devonia, Derhin cuns.

Tum Dumium specus u

Amburumque vide subolum imprimisque puellam
Dignam qun onim! Superi, binosque puellos
Angelioos a a ι

It was probably laid aeide, when Hohbes on the death of hin
pupil left the Cavendish family for a while: “nimium neglect<
tus abiviff: (Vl-m Carm. exp). And if the date of 16³6 is
correctly attributed by Anthony Wood to the first edition, it
wne published just before hin retum from nbi-oud in 16³7 with
his second pupil, the son os the late Earl.

'l'he only editions that the Editor hm met with, are the quarto
edition without date or title-page, which seems to be that to
which Anthony Wood assigna the date os 1636 : md the oo-
tavo edition os 1678, published by Hobbes' bookseller, Wil-
linm Crook, niong with nn English translation by “ a Person
os Qualityss'
